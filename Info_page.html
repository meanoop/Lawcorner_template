                        <p>As an entrepreneur or&nbsp;business owner its natural to feel positive and excited about the future of your business but there can be a&nbsp;flipside: you might find it hard to contemplate how things could go wrong. This can lead to the temptation to cut corners and, as many business owners have found, end up paying the price later.</p>
                        <p>You're likely to&nbsp;have business relationships with many different people including&nbsp;suppliers, customers, co-founders, partners, employees and contractors. Depending on the nature of your business you might also engage consultants, distributors, manufacturers, distributors or have arrangements with licencees, franchisee's and investors.</p>
                        <p>Your business can be&nbsp;exposed to risk if these relationships are left to chance and not documented. You can minimise these risks by getting advice from a business lawyer to ensure there's a structure around&nbsp;how things will work in key business&nbsp;relationships and what happens if things go wrong.</p>
                        <p>In this section we give a brief overview of&nbsp;the main areas of business law, from planning and legal structures, buying and selling a business or franchise, contracts and agreements, online business and protecting your ideas.</p></div>
